The target of the task is to simulate
an M/M/k system with a single queue.
The study is mainly to show various results of
a queue against its ro parameter. ro is defined as the ratio of arrival rate vs
service rate. For the sake of comparison, while plotting results from simulation,
also analytical results are also produced.
