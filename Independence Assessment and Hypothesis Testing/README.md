# Simulation
1. Independence Assessment through Correlation plot and Scatter plot
2. Hypothesizing Families of Distributions
3. Estimation of Parameters
4. Determining How Representative the Fitted Distributions are through:
   * Frequency Comparisons
   * Distribution Function Difference
   * P-P and Q-Q Plot
   * Chi-Square Test
